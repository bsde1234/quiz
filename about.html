<h1>About Quiz Maker</h1>
<section><u>Purpose</u></section>
Quiz Maker is a single-page application meant to assist individuals that want to 
create basic quizzes for their website and/or personal use.  The quiz is coded in 
a way that those with a basic understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript can modify values 
to further personalize different aspects to suit their personal needs.  This app is a simple, 
but effective solution for teachers, or even students, seeking to create interactive study 
guides that they can share with others.

<section><u>I do not own a website, can I still use Quiz Maker?</u></section>
Yes.  By saving the completed file as a .html extension file, you can open your quiz in 
your internet browser and use it locally.  Sharing the file with others will allow them 
to take your quiz as well.  Quiz Maker makes sharing study guides with peers quick and 
easy.

<section><u>How do I get started?</u></section>
Download all the files in the repository at my <a href = "https://github.com/Yaulthoon/Quiz-Maker"> 
GitHub</a>.  Make sure to save all the files in the same folder on your computer or Cloud storage.  
After downloading all the files, simply open the index.html file in your browser to get started.</br>
<Strong><span style = "color: red">Warning:  Quiz Maker uses local Ajax calls.  The only confirmed 
browsers I know of that support this behavior are <u>Firefox and Microsoft Edge.</u></span></strong></br> 
If you want to use this app, then please be aware that not all browsers currently support it.  
I may host the app on a server eventually, but until then, 
please be aware of this potential issue.

<section><u>Will my quiz only work on certain browsers as well?</u></section>
The quiz provided to you by this app will work in all browsers.

<section><u>Will my quiz work on my smartphone?</u></section>
Yes.  Make sure to save the file directly to your phone and open the file in the browser 
of your choice.  The process is the same as opening it on a computer.  Your quiz follows 
responsive web design principles and will scale to the dimensions of your screen.  For 
best results, switch your phone to landscape (wide) mode.

<section><u>Will the quiz score itself?</u></section>
Yes, the quiz will provide a score upon completion.  It will also highlight questions that 
are answered incorrectly and display the correct choice.  This helps the user identify 
which questions that they may need to review.  

<section><u>One of the answers to one of my questions is incorrect.  Can I fix this?</u></section>
Yes, you can.  This requires a brief explanation of a basic Javascript concept, but this 
solution does not require you to familiarize yourself with Javascript at all.
Open your html document in a text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++, Atom, or etcetera.  
Underneath the &#60script&#62 tag, find the phrase "const key" that contains a list of 
numbers from 0 - 3.  This is what is known as an array that contains numbers, technically 
string versions of numbers, that form an answer key.  0 being the first answer and 3 being 
the final answer if your question contains 4 possible choices.
Simply identify the number of the question that you want to adjust and find its corresponding 
answer in the array.  This means if you wanted to adjust the answer to question #5, then you 
would find the fifth element in the array and modify it to the new answer. </br>
<strong>
Example:  const key = ["1","2","0","0","3"].  "3" would be the fifth element in the array.
</strong>

<section><u>Can I use the code provided by the app as part of a school-related project?</u></section>
If you plan to use the quiz you create as part of a school-related project related to website 
development, please be sure to properly attribute this app as a comment in your html code.  
You can simply designate a landing site of <span style = "color: blue"> 
https://github.com/Yaulthoon/Quiz-Maker</span> at the bottom of your code.
